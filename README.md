# Second-Year Dynamics Textbook
Active learning style textbook aimed at second-year dynamics (classical mechanics) undergraduate courses

## Basic Information
This textbook is a work in progress and will follow a similar format as the first-year active learning textbook, [Introductory Physics: Building Models to Describe Our World](https://github.com/OSTP/PhysicsArtofModelling).  **All latex files will be uploaded to this repository in the near future**.  At present, this repository contains:
* [PDF copy of the in-progress textbook](https://github.com/OSTP/Dynamics_Textbook/blob/main/tex/phys206_f24_textbook.pdf)
* [Example problems using Jupyter notebooks for plotting graphs](https://github.com/OSTP/Dynamics_Textbook/tree/main/py_notebooks)
* Videos demonstrating common mathematical concepts or tricks when solving problems
