## Mathematical Concepts

[Indefinite vs Definite Integrals](https://queensu.ca.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=ba43564b-4edd-4455-a236-b068014b59a1): This video compares solutions using the definite integral (limits given) with the indefinite integral (solve for a constant).

[Partial vs Full Derivatives](https://queensu.ca.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=2a56bc97-000d-42e6-ba9c-b06900e3bae7): This video compares partial derivatives and full derivatives.
